## About this project

In the week of June 5th to 9th, we celebrate Word Environment Week

There are many ways to commemorate this day, some campaigning for the envioronment, others campaigning for the environment. With that in mind and this week of great importance, Rocketseat started this week the Next Level Week, or #NLW, a week for people who enjoy programming, learn or deepen their knowledge through web and mobile projects.

And in this week of deepening and knowledge of new technologies, we developed this application, with the intention of creating a site that allows the registration of recycling points, to allow sustainable recycling.
