# Ecoleta

## Trilha Starter

### The week from June 5th until June 09th, we celebrate the world environment week.

<h4>
There are several ways to celebrate that day, some campaigning for the environment, others campaigning for the environment. Thinking about it and this week of great importance, Rocketseat started this week Next Level Week, or #NLW, a week for people who like programming, learn or deepen their knowledge through web and mobile projects.

<h4>
The project I'm participating in, and a site called 'Ecoleta', a site for you to search where collection points near your region / register a collection point, with the intention of promoting recycling and saving the environment.
During this week, despite being only the 3rd day, many lessons have been learned so far, lessons like:
</h4>
<p>
  
- [X] Programming has no secret to learn quickly, it has to be little by little, doing small projects every day, and always willing to learn and practice.
<br/>
- [X] Be always a dedicated person and always seek to innovate in your projects, try something different, take more chances.
</p>

<h3>
This project is already on my list of favorites and Rocketseat, along with Diego and Mayk, are to be congratulated
